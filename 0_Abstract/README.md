# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

A car windscreen wiper, sometimes known as a windshield wiper or wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water,
and/or debris. Almost all motor vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and cabin watercraft—as well as some aircraft—have one or more of 
these wipers, which are usually required by law.A wiper is made up of a metal arm with one end pivoting and the other end having a long rubber blade attached. A motor,
usually an electric motor, drives the arm, however pneumatic power is also utilised in some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth across the glass, removing any
water, any precipitation, or other obstructions to view.

A windscreen washer system is also used on some vehicles to improve and broaden the wiper(s) function to dry or icy conditions. Several well-placed nozzles spray water
or antifreeze window washer fluid at the windscreen with this method. When utilised in conjunction with the wiper blades, this mechanism aids in the removal of dirt and
dust from the windscreen.In this project I explain about how wiper works based on stm32, an ARM based Microcontroller.

A Wiper Speed Control System Controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all types of 
vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition so in
this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rain.
